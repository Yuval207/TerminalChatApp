# TerminalChatBot
This repository contains the source code for a terminal-based chat application written in Python. The chat application allows two users to connect and chat in real-time over a network connection.

To get started, clone the repository and run the server script on one machine. This will start the chat server and allow other users to connect. Then, run the client script on another machine and enter the IP address of the machine running the server. You can then start chatting with other users who have connected to the chat server.

The chat application uses the sockets module in Python to create a network connection and exchange messages between clients. It also includes basic features such as displaying a list of connected users and handling user disconnections.

You can customize the chat application by modifying the code. For example, you can add additional features or change the way messages are displayed.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community.

Overall, the Terminal Chat Application using Python is a simple and easy way to chat with other users directly from the terminal. We hope you enjoy using it and find it useful for communication.
